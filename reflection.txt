Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team to collaborate on a single project because branches can be edited, tinkered, destroyed, or rebuilt and they won't affect the main "trunk" AKA the rest of the project. Being able to work on a project in smaller portions is great for ensuring that progress is made and never lost due to code compatibility issues. Especially as we begin to improve our coding skills, our projects will become more and more complicated, with hundreds of lines of code. It would be impossible to continue making meaningful progress on the project if we have to spend so much time making sure that nothing breaks as we write new functions and algorithms.

Branches promote teamwork as well. The reality is that reading other peoples' code is very difficult. Having branches means that the crossing of one another's code is at a minimum. We don't necessarily need to understand practically what each of us are doing within our own branches, so long as those branches connect to the trunk well and are efficient pieces of code. It ensures that each team member is able to write code however they feel comfortable, while still bringing about teamwork and engagement.
